## [Complexities & Big O Explained](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)

Understanding time and space complexity is crucial for writing efficient code and acing interviews. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview:

| Complexity | Big O | Examples |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Constant   | O(1)  | Hash table lookup, Accessing array element |
| Logarithmic| O(log n) | Binary search, Searching in sorted array |
| Linearithmic| O(n log n) | Merge sort, Heap sort |
| Quadratic  | O(n^2) | Bubble sort, Selection sort |
| Cubic      | O(n^3) | Floyd-Warshall, 3-nested loops |
| Factorial  | O(n!)  | Traveling Salesman, permutations |

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify).
3. Make a pull request.

## When to Contribute

1. If there is no solution to a problem.
2. If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3. If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size, comment out the original solution and make a pull request with your solution.
